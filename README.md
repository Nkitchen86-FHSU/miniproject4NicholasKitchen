Mini Project 4 - Zooventory
 
## Description
 
Zooventory is an application that makes tracking animals and food easy. After getting signed up and logged in, the user can add animals and food items. The user can also edit and delete the animals and food items if needed. Whenever the user feeds an animal, they will use the calculator. The calculator does 2 things:
1. It will subtract the entered amount from the food supply.
2. It will log the last time an animal has been fed.
